## Introduction

1) These iPython notebooks require a SQL database too large to upload.
I could upload the individual csv files and the code to create the databse, but I think it would be easier to link
my Google Drive with the ZIP file containing the database and notebooks:

2) These projects are for skill-building and baseball knowledge-demonstrating.
Feel free to use.
