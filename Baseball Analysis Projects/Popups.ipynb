    "## Popups\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few guarantees in baseball. Three strikes and you're out. A ball hit fair 450 feet is a home run. And a popup should be caught. Popups are nearly guaranteed outs, placing value on them as a batted ball outcome. Knowing whether or not a pitcher can induce popups is valuable information, especially if it can be predicted. I chose to explore batted ball prediciton, specifically for popups, to see if I could predict popup rates for pitchers. I believe, if producing popups is a skill, a pitcher who is inducing fewer popups than predicted may be facing poor luck and is undervalued."

Even then, though, this model heavily implies that batters contribute to pitcher popup rates. To better enhance this model, I would need to include batter characteristics, like bat angle, swing path and bat speed, to better predict popup rates.\n",

After limiting the sample of pitchers who have allowed 400 or more balls in play, we can see that those who have a larger sample size have more accurate projections. A study I reference below, from MedCalc, suggests a certain calculation to find the suggested minimum sample size. That sample size for this model was 579 balls in play, which no pitcher has reached yet in 2017. I will revisit this after the 2017 season, and may consider including 2016 data as well to increase sample sizes."

    "\n",
    "I believe the goal of predicting batted ball types is feasible, given the right data. Clearly, the outcome of pitches is dependent on both pitchers and batters, and building a model based on statistics from only one of the two parties is incomplete. As baseball data continues to become available to the public, I will continue to explore it and revise the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant result of this project is that predicting popup rates for individual pitchers seems possible. The value in popup rate prediction is that popups are almost guaranteed outs and pitchers who should be producing more popups than they are may be undervalued in the marketplace of MLB pitchers.\n",
